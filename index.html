<p>These are my notes for making the most precise text and images for publication, mainly for PDF and print media. Unlike articles written for viewing on the web, publications are more rigid and should look good in higher densities like 600 DPI (dots-per-inch). I am only listing techniques that are missed by the vast majority of authors. View <a href="illustrative-notes-for-publishing-aesthetics.pdf">this page saved as a PDF file</a> for a more accurate rendering of this page's examples, to see finer detail in the images.<p>

<h3>Scaling up the display resolution before taking a screenshot</h3>
<p>Screen resolutions are typically in 96 DPI for desktop at 100% scaling, so screenshots taken on a desktop don't have much detail, compared to a high-resolution print of 600 DPI. They'll appear pixelated when printed out, or when shown in a PDF file where it may be stretched to fit the width of the reader's screen. There's a trick to fix this: on your desktop operating system settings, adjust the Display scaling as high as you can. This scaling reduces the space available on screen, but as long as you can fit what you need in a screenshot, it will provide more pixels for detail when you take the screenshot. Below is an example of screenshots of the exact same interface taken at 100%, 200%, and 400% scaling, then placed in the same Word Document and saved as PDF to view.</p>

<h2 id="compiling"><a href="#compiling">The final step&mdash;compiling</a></h2>

<p>If you are compiling the final PDF file yourself, you can tidy up the resulting PDF file.</p>

<p>I tend to get the best results with Save as PDF using the MacOS version of Microsoft Word, and with the default pdflatex for compiling LaTeX source files. The Adobe Acrobat tools seem to not get the links right, and rasterizes and compresses the graphics unnecessarily, sometimes even reducing quality while increasing the file size at the same time. I have also tried compiling to PostScript (.ps) and then using GhostScript to convert to PDF, but the rendering seems to be less crisp.</p>
